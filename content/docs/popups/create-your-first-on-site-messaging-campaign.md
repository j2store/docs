Convert the website visitors into customers by showing personalised messages based on the customer behaviour.

Here is a best example:

You can show a 10% coupon in a popup or an action bar when the customer tries to exit your website or shop (it is called an exit-intent marketing).

Researches found that "Exit-intent based campaigns" can increase your conversions and revenue by at least 50 to 60%.  (**Heads up!** Don't believe those that claim 300% increase. That can't be true in a real world scenario!)
**Exit-intent strategy examples**
* **On product pages:** Stop users leaving after viewing a product by sweetening the deal somehow (eg: coupon code).
* **Cart abandonment:** Reduce cart abandonment with a last minute offer or ask people to save their shopping list.
* **Landing pages:** When your landing page message doesnâ€™t quite work, exit popups provide one last chance to make an offer.
* **Running discounts:** People might be more willing to hand over their email address for a special offer that lasts a week, rather than forcing them to buy now.
* **Price/availability alerts:** When prices or availability often change (flights, properties, job positions, etc.), offering alerts is a great way to get people involved with your brand.

Campaignrabbit helps you create engaging **exit-intent popups** through its visual drag and drop editor and powerful behaviour targeting engine.

Let's create an exit-intent popup as your first on-site messaging campaign
**Creating your first on-site messaging campaign**

Login to <link-text url="https://app.campaignrabbit.com/login" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campignrabbit.</link-text>

Navigate to Campaigns -> On site popups  and click "Create New Campaign" to get started

![onsite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/campaignrabbit/cr-media/master/images/docs/campaigns/onsite-messaging-campaigns/onsite.png)

In the next screen, choose the campaign type. For this example, let's choose the "popup" type

![onsite-popup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/campaignrabbit/cr-media/master/images/docs/campaigns/onsite-messaging-campaigns/onsitepopup.png)

You will be presented with a gallery of templates. Choose one and proceed. You can customize this template to your branding requirements in the drag and drop editor

![tempopup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/campaignrabbit/cr-media/master/images/docs/campaigns/onsite-messaging-campaigns/tempop.png)

Now, you can see the visual editor. You can add / edit / remove text, images, buttons and more.

A popular exit-intent strategy is to show a coupon code with a discount when they try to exit. It motivates the visitor to buy.

In the same step, you can also set up "Display rules" .

These rules help you control when the popup should appear. For our example, let's choose the Exit-Detected rule

![exit-detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/campaignrabbit/cr-media/master/images/docs/campaigns/onsite-messaging-campaigns/exit-detection.png)

NOTE: The Rule engine is very powerful and you can combine it with other conditions as well.
Example: You can show the popup when the customer is on a specific url (example your "Shop page" and tries to exit from that page)


And that's all! You have successfully created your first on-site messaging campaign.
