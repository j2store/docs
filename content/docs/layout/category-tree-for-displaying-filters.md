2. Create menu items with the names of categories.
3. Add the menu items to the menu filters.
4. Navigate to Extensions->modules->New->Menu.
5. Choose the menu filters in the option "Select Menu".
6. Set the position to "j2store-filter-right-top"(Please note that you have to type this fully at the position field).
