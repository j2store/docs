If you are a seller of digital goods and services, you would probably wondering about the new European VAT rules that came into effect from January 1, 2015.

Since the rules are a bit of pain, we have come up with a simplified guide which will help you implement the new rules easily in your J2Store joomla shopping cart.

**The New VAT rules**

In simple terms, the new VAT rules are:

* if the company sells to any countries in the EU, they will have to charge VAT in the country of the buyer instead of the seller.
* if the buyer of the digital goods is an individual, the company has to charge the VAT percentage from the country of the buyer
* if the buyer of the digital goods is a company (with a valid VAT number), there is a 0 percent VAT charge.
* if the buyer of the digital goods is a company without a VAT number or has an incorrect VAT number, then VAT of the country of the buyer must be charged.
* if the company sells digital goods to companies or individuals in their own country, local VAT needs to be charged.


**Implementing VAT rules in J2Store**

**EU VAT plugin**

We have created a VAT plugin that helps you implement the VAT rules automatically.Download and install the plugin from here:http://j2store.org/extensions/general-plugins.html

Then go to Joomla admin -> Plugin Manager and Enable the EU VAT plugin

**Implementation**

Let us assume that your company is located in : United Kingdom, BristolAnd your home country (local ) VAT is 21 %

1. **Store Configuration**

Go to Joomla admin – J2Store – Set up – Configuration - Store tab

Set the Default Country to United KingdomSet your Default Zone to Bristol

2. **Tax rule for Home Country**


First, we should define the geozone and tax rates for the home country, that is the country in which your shop is located.

2.1 **Define Geozone**


Go to Joomla admin – J2Store – Localization – Geozones – New

**Geozone Name:**
 Home VAT Zone ( It can be anything. It is used just as reference )

**State :** Published

**Add country / Zone**

Choose United Kingdom from the Dropdown list and add it

Save and close

**2.2. Define Tax rate:**

Go to Joomla admin – J2Store – Localization – Tax Rates – New

Name        : Home VAT RateTax Percent    : 21Geozone     :  Home VAT Zone
Status     : Published

3. Tax rule for an EU Country
Let us take Germany for this example.   Let us say, Germany's VAT charge is:  25 %

A few countries might have same VAT rate for the digital goods. You can group them under one geozone.

For this example, I am going to stick with one EU country, that is Germany.

**3.1 Define Geozone**

Go to Joomla admin – J2Store – Localization – Geozones – NewGeozone Name : Germany VAT Zone ( It can be anything. It is used just as reference )State : Published

Add country / ZoneChoose Germany from the Dropdown list and add it

If some other EU countries also implement a 25 % VAT, then you can group them under this geozone itself

Save and close

**3.2. Define Tax rate:**

Go to Joomla admin – J2Store – Localization – Tax Rates – New

Name        : Germany VAT RateTax Percent    : 25Geozone     :  Germany VAT ZoneStatus     : Published

4. **Setting up the tax profile**

It is sufficient to set up ONE tax profile for digital goods, in which we can associate many tax rates.

Go to Joomla admin → J2Store – Localization → Tax profiles → New

Tax Profile Name    : Digital Goods Tax ProfileState            : Published

**Tax Rates Mapping**

4.1. Choose Home VAT Rate 21 %  and choose Billing Address as the Associated Address.

4.2. Choose the Germany VAT Rate 25 %  and choose Billing Address as the Associated Address.

Save.

5. **Applying tax profile to a product**

J2Store uses native Joomla articles as products. So go ahead and create a product.

Go to Joomla admin – Article Manager – New or open your digital product.

In J2Store Tab → Item Tax , Choose Digital Goods Tax Profile.

Fill in other relevant fields for your product and save.

**Application of VAT rules with Examples:**

Now we have successfully configured the tax rules in J2Store. Let us see how they will get applied for different scenarios

**Example 1: Buyer  ( can be an INDIVIDUAL or company ) from the same country (Home country )**

Our shop is located in United Kingdom. And the buyer is from the same country. So local tax of 21 percent applies.

**Example 2: Buyer ( INDIVIDUAL ) from a different EU country (Germany )**

The buyer is from Germany and he is an Individual customer. So we are charging him the Germany's VAT rate of 25 %

**Example 3: Buyer ( COMPANY ) from a different EU country WITHOUT a valid VAT Number**

The customer is from Germany. He has entered a company name. But his VAT number is INVALID.  So we apply the Germany's VAT rate of 25 %.

(the EU VAT plugin validates the VAT number provided against the EU database )

**Example 4: Buyer ( COMPANY ) from a different EU country WITH a valid VAT Number**

The customer is from Germany.  His VAT number is VALID.  So NO tax is applied.
