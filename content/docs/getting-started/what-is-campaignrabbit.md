### What can you do with Campaignrabbit?

If you are running an eCommerce business and sell goods or services online, you can use Campaignrabbit to
* **Recover abandoned carts** - You can create a campaign that "automatically" sends when there is a cart abandonment. Studies show that you can recover at least 35% of abandoned carts when you re-engage with your customers.
* **Welcome emails** - Welcome emails generate 320% more revenue than regular promotional emails. Nearly every e-commerce site collects the email addresses of both casual browsers and avid customers. Send a personalised welcome message when a customer makes a purchase in the store. It makes your brand more professional and trust worthy.
* **Win inactive customers** - Email marketing lists naturally degrade by about 22.5% every year so itâ€™s important that you re-engage customers who aren't taking action any longer. Not only is it good for your sales, it's also good for your email unsubscribe rates.
* **Follow-up Emails** - Once your customer has made that purchase, it is time to get in touch with him. Just ask for a review 2 days after you delivered the product. Or just ask them for a feedback.
* **Popups** - Trigger a popup  / slide-in message  when the customer lingers in the cart page for a minute or two. The popup can contain a coupon code that motivates customers to purchase
* **Action bars**  - Create action bars and display them at the top or the bottom to run a flash sale with a coupon or showcase a new arrival at discounted rate. Again, No coding required. Use our drag and drop visual builder for creating the messages.
* **Dynamic product recommendations** - Send personalised product recommendations to your customers that can drive repeat purchases.  Example: Suggest a pair of socks when a customer purchases a shoe.
* **Get Actionable Insights and Store Metrics** - Keep tab of your store's key metrics and performance indicators. Campaignrabbit provides a dashboard with actionable insights and metrics about your store.

### Who uses Campaignrabbit?
* **Growth focussed sales teams** to drive repeat purchases and get more sales
* **Marketing teams** that create data-driven promotional strategies and look for 360 degree view of their customer base.
