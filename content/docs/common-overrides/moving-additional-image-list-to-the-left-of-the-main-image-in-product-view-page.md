If you are trying to move the additional images to the left side of the main image in the product item view page, then it is possible by creating an override as follows:

**Steps to be done: **

* Create a file called "view_images.php" under "/templates/your site's template/html/com_j2store/templates/your sub-template/" 
* Paste the following code there:

  Save.
This would display the additional images list to the left of the main image on the product's item view
