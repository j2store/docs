This, as everyone knows, paying at the time of purchase, in cash. This can be either at the product outlet or at customer's home or office, where the delivery is made. For cash transactions, a surcharge will be collected and it may be a fixed value (e.g., $ 20.00) or a percentage of the total bill amount (e.g., 0.02%).
