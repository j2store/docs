### Pricing

**Subscription price :** 
Enter the membership price (for example, $  29) based on either daily or weekly or monthly or yearly basis.For example, if you would like to give subscription price  $ 29 for only 3 months, then enter $ $ 29 in the first text box and then choose every 3rd from the dropdown list and then choose month from third dropdown list.

**Subscription length :**
The subscription length duration will be listed based on the recurring period you selected above.  For example, if your subscription product's duration period is only for 3 months, Choose 3 months. So the subscription will end at the  end of 3rd month.If you would like to give a life time price for your subscription product (i.e.) wants to collect $29 at the end of every 3 months for lifetime, choose Never Expire to Subscription length. So $
29 for every 3rd month for lifetime.

**Add / Remove user groups :** Users will be added and removed from the Joomla user groups when their subscription to the level is enabled or disabled.

**Sign-up fee :** This app allows you to collect one time set up fee or sign up fee from your customers. Enter your sign up fee here. For example, $5 or $10.
