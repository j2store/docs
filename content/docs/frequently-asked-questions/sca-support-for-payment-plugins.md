**SCA support for payment plugins**

In the European union, a new regulation for online payments would be rolled out in September 2019. This would require your payment plugins to be compliant to the SCA regulation.

**What is SCA:

**Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a new European regulatory requirement to reduce fraud and make online payments more secure. To accept payments once SCA goes into effect, you will need to build additional authentication into your checkout flow.** 

**

**Will i need to update my payment plugins:**

Yes, we are in the process ofÂ updating our payment plugins to ensure that they support the SCA compliance.

This update would be rolled out before September, when the regulations come into effect.

**What payment methods require update:**

The following payment methods require update:

- Stripe
- Paypal

**Has the Stripe plugin been updated to support SCA**

With the current latest version(effective of the date 01.07.2019), the in-built form mode of Stripe supports SCA.
The version on the site is currently: 1.49

**Has Paypal been updated to support SCA**

Yes, the standard Paypal plugin does support SCA by default since the transactions occur at the Payment gateway and not within the merchant site.
As far as Paypal PRO is concerned, SCA support has been included in the version 2.15 and onwards.
