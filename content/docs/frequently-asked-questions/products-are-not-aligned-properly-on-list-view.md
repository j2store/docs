The alignment of the products in the list view is based on many factors. In J2Store, the products are displayed in a product block structure.

What the product block consists:

The product block typically consists of

 - The product image

 - The product name

 - The price, SKU and stock

 - The description part(while many users don't publish the description on the list view, some users do)

 - The add to cart button or the view details button  

**Factors causing misalignment:**

**Product images being of different heights**

In J2Store, the products are arranged in a block structure. The product image, which is also a part of the product block plays a major role in determining the product alignment.

That is, when you use images of varying heights on your site, the product block of the image with a greater height would be large than the one with a relatively smaller product image.

**Solution:** To a certain extent, this could be overcome by minor CSS tweaks. However, if your images are of entirely different heights, then you might want to consider using uniformly sized images for a neat layout.

**The product title being big and greater font-size**

When you use higher font-sizes for your product title and have a big name for the products, then the product block would be aligned up and down.

**Solution: **To use a font-size of about  16px would do good. Also having product titles within two words is a good practise to get a neat layout.

**Publishing Description in the list view**

Generally, most users don't publish the description on the list view but a very few users do. This might also cause the products to be aligned up and down.

**Solution:** To a certain extent, this could also be overcome by adding minor CSS tweaks. However, if you have a lengthy description, then it is better to avoid publishing it on the list view since this might lead to a layout not so clean.
