Manual messages are something that are sent on one shot.
Let's take an *example* :
You are trying to send a campaign for New Year!! On such events,  you can create an email and send it out to people rightaway. (Yes! rightaway)

This has **no start date, no end date.. No hidden settings..**
Just send the campaign and start monitoring the open rate and click rate.

Seasonal Campaigns are the best example for manual messages.

#### What is seasonal campaign ?
* Campaigns created based on festivals/holiday for specific countries.

#### Why seasonal campaign ?
