**What and why Upselling campaigns ?**
* Upselling induces a customer to purchase a higher end product while cross selling suggests the purchase of additional products.
* Large businesses usually combine upselling and cross-selling to maximize profit.

**How to create a Upselling Campaigns ?**
* Navigate to Campaigns tab from dashboard.
* Click on "Create New Campaign" from the "Automated Messages" section.

Match all customers whose **product name** is hard disk and **last ordered** on is more than 2 days.

In the *Campaign Settings:*
* Specify category(if any).
* Set the start date.
* Set end date(optional).

Here, setting the start date is not mandatory.

When there are orders with the specified condition, mails will be sent automatically(if campaign is set to live)
