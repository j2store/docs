Who doesn't prefer choices when they wish to buy their favorite t-shirt ? Obviously, your users would love when the products have additional options.
J2Store allows you to create <link-text url="http://docs.j2store.org/catalog/options" target="_blank" rel="noopener">options of various types</link-text>

Here is how you could create product options and add them to your products.

**Instance:**

Lets suppose you are trying to sell a customizable t-shirt. So this t-shirt has options called color, size and requests users to fill in the custom text that they will have to print on the t-shirt.

Now that we know the requirements, let us get into the process of setting the options up.

**Creating the options**

- Navigate to **J2Store->Catalog->Options. **Click on the New option.

- Enter the unique name, display or presentation(in our case, let us create color of the type radio and size of the type checkbox first).
- Choose the type and set the published status.
- Add option values, images(they would be displayed only if the option type is radio) and specify the ordering(the order in which they would be listed in the product part).

- Create a text area type option for collecting the text to be displayed on the shirt.

-  Navigate to J2Store->Catalog->Products.
-  Edit your product article, click on the J2Store cart tab.
- Select the options tab at the left pane.
