# Product Filters

These are used to narrow out the search for a particular product.

In this page, first Fiter Groups are created and in each group some Filter Names will be added, and based on the Filter Name, products will be searched.

- E.g., Filter Group : Clothing
- Filter Names: Mens, Women, Kids

```
NOTE: If you are adding a large number of filters (1000+), make sure "max_input_vars" in your PHP.ini is set to a higher number as well
```

This is illustrated in the image below:
