#### How to set up date range based discounts:

If you are trying to set up date range based discounts, you could do so by setting up advanced pricing as follows:

**Discount date range: 02-04-2019 to 16-04-2019 
   Regular price of the product: 20
   Discounted price: 10**

Navigate to your product article ->J2Store cart tab ->pricing->Set advanced pricing->mention the date range in the Date range(optional) field, set the discounted rate and click create.

So when users buy this product, within the above mentioned date range, they would receive the discount mentioned. 

#### How to set up quantity based discounts: 

This option might be useful when you are trying to set up quantity range based discounts on your products.

**Quantity range: 2 and above
    Regular price: 20
    Discounted price: 10**

With the above setup, when user buys 2 and more quantities of the given product, they would receive each quantity in 10$.

That is when users buys 5 quantities of the product, the total price would be

**5\*10=50 instead of 5\*20=100 **

#### How to setup customer group based discounts: 

When you wish to offer customer-group based pricing, then you could choose the customer groups in the customer group option and set the price accordingly.

**User group eligible for discount: wholesale
   Regular price: 20
   Discounted price: 10**

So, with the above advanced pricing set up, users of the group Wholesale receive discount for the product.

### Creating Advanced pricing:
