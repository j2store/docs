Organizing your products is an important factor to increase the user-friendliness of your store. The following article describes how your products could be organized.

### Options available:

Ordering options could be found under Menu manager->Your product's menu item->Common options tab-> Article order.

#### The following are the options:

**Use global** - This would display the articles in the order as specified on the Joomla Global c        configuration(under System->Global configuration->Articles->Shared->Article order). 
**Featured products(articles) first**\- The products that are marked as featured, would be listed     first followed by the others. 
**Most recent first** - The most recently created products/ articles would be listed first.
**Oldest first**- This option would allow the product that are the oldest to be displayed first.
**Title alphabetical**- With this option you could sort your products based on their titles in   alphabetical order.
**Title reverse alphabetical**- This option would sort the products in the reverse alphabetical order.
**Author Alphabetical**- The products would be sorted based on their author names alphabetically. 
**Author reverse alphabetical**\- Products will be ordered based on their author names in    reverse alphabetical order.
**Most hits**\- The products that have received most hits would be listed first.
**Least hits**\- The products with the least hits would appear first.
**Article order**\- The order in which they are sorted in the Content->articles part would be the order of the products at the frontend.
