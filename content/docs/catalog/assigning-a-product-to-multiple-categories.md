# Assigning a product to multiple categories

With the conventional list layout, it is possible to organize products based on their categories. However, there is one catch. It is not possible to assign a product to multiple categories.

Overcoming this, now we have the tag layout where it is possible for a product to be assigned to multiple categories.

**Steps to be followed:**

- Create tags that you wish to link with the product.
- Create a product and add the tags to the product.
- Create menus and link the tags with the respective menus.

**Scenario**

Products like Coffee mugs should be available under two categories- Kitchen appliances and Gifts.

**Steps to be done:**

- Create two tags:GiftsKitchen appliances
- Create a product named coffee mugs.
- Assign both the tags to the product article.
- Create menu items of the type Product tag view:Kitchen appliances associatingÂ the tag kitchen appliancesGifts associating the tag Gifts
- Now the product coffee mugs will be available in both Kitchen appliances and Gifts.

Likewise, we can assign products to as many categories as we wish.
