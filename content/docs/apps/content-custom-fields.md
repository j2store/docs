To specify more information about your product, you might beÂ using the description part of the product page. Generally, the description part will be displayed at the bottom of the product page after the title, price and the cart button. What if you wish to display text somewhere else apart from the description part?

Well, of course, you might consider using special module positions or publishing custom html modules. Some might even think of trying overrides. But in these cases, the text would be static.But, when you want the content to be dynamic, how do you achieve this?

**NOTE: This plugin only allows you to enter dynamic data to each of your products.

It is not possible to display form fields or any other input fields at the storefront and collect user input using this field.


Here are the steps to be done:

* Create Joomla fields.
* Download and install the app Content Custom fields.
* Configure the app by choosing where the content has to be displayed.
* Specify the content in the Fields tab of your product article and insert the shortcode for field in the content section of the article.



#### Create Joomla fields

Joomla custom fields can be created by carrying out the following steps:

* Navigate to Content->Fields->New.
* We are going to specify text in our product page. So the Field type must be set to Text.
* Give the field a name, description, label and other details.
