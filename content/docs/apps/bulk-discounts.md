# Bulk discounts

Encourage customers to purchase more by providing bulk discounts depending on the ordered quantity and on the specific product.

Bulk discounts can be defined at site-wide (globally), category wise or per product wise. Provide a fixed per product discount or percentage of the total purchase. The plugin implements a greater flexibility in providing discounts without requiring the customers to apply a coupon.

You can also restrict the application of the discount depending on the customer groups.

**Requirements**

- PHP 5.4 or higher
- Joomla 3.3 or above
- J2Store 3.2.x or above

**Installation Instructions**

1. Use the Joomla installer to install the app.
2. Go to J2store -> Apps and enable app.
3. Open the App Bulk Discount.

**Priority of the discounts:

**Here is how the priority of the discount rules is decided. Following is the priority from high to low.

- **Product-level settings**
- **Category-level settings**
- **Global settings**

That is, when there is a product-level discount set and a category-level discount set, the product-level rule would be of higher priority than the category-level rule.

The same goes for the global rule as well. At any cost, the product-level setting would be given the high priority.

Also, when there is a category-level discount set, the product level setting for enable bulk discount parameter should be NO. If not, the product-level setting would be given priority, thus overriding the category level setting.

**Product level bulk discounts:

Bulk discount plugin offers a product-level setting. So, if you are trying to set up product-specific discounts, then that is also possible by following the below steps:

- Navigate to J2Store->Catalog->Products->choose the product for which you are trying to offer discounts.
- Click on the J2Store cart tab and select the apps tab on the left pane.
- Set the enable bulk discounts option to YES.

- **Discount type**


1. **Fixed-amount per product -** To set up a fixed price discount for the product choose this option. For example: 20$ discount, or a 50$ discount.
2. **Cart percentage - **To set up a percentage discount at the cart page for a particular product, choose this option. For example: a 20% discount, a 30% discount. As the name goes, this discount would be applied only at the cart level. 


- **Promotional text to show under each item in the cart(only for cart page) **

This setting lets you mention a promo message at the cart page alone. The text entered here would be displayed at the cart page.

- **Combine product quantity in cart **

When this option is checked, the quantities of the product would be calculated cumulatively and discount would be added accordingly. For example: If you are setting up a discount for a T-shirt product, and the t-shirt has options, say, size as Small, Medium and Large. If the user chooses to buy a shirt of the size small and one shirt of the size medium, then should these two quantities be added?

- Next comes the part where you choose the quantity range, usergroup and the discount value.
