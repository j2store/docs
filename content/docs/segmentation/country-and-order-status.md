I am going to sort out all the customers belonging to the **country** USA and the **order status** in completed.
![segment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/campaignrabbit/cr-media/master/images/docs/segmentation/segment.png)
Match all is selected.
Two filter conditions are set. One for country and another one for order status.
* Navigate to people tab from the campaignrabbit dashboard.
* I am giving Match all and setting the conditions accordingly.
* The chosen conditions are country and order status.
* Hit on create segment and provide suitable segment name.
**Note:**
* There are different parameters you can choose from.
* For the condition, Country we have different parameters like Is, Is not, Starts With, Ends With, Contains and so on.

* Similar way, for Order Status there are different parameters such as Paid, Unpaid, Pending, Cancelled and Failed.
![order-status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/campaignrabbit/cr-media/master/images/docs/segmentation/orderstatus.png)
* You can combine any of the parameters according to your requirement.
* Popular Combinations are

Country contains America and the order status is Pending.
Country Has Any Value and Order Status is Completed.
County Starts With United and Order Status is Cancelled.
