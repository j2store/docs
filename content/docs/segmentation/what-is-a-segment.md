## What are segments ?
* Segments are grouping a set of customers for your reference based on certain conditions.
* Segments are an optional setup.
* Now, since we know that segments are nothing but setting up conditions. It's time to get familiar with the conditions.

Campaignrabbit offers 15+ conditions with each condition having different attribute.
The available conditions are

Name
E-mail
Company
City
Country
Region
Product Name
Sku
Price
Total spent
Total orders
Items in order
Last ordered on
Signed up
Order status
Customer Group
Last Clicked
Last Contacted
Last Opened

A prologue of each of the conditions:
***Name:***
Providing customer name.
If you want to find out the products purchased by a particular customer you can use this condition.

***E-mail:***
Customer's mail id.
Like generate mails to customers whose mail id contains "@gmail.com".

***Company:***

***City:***

***Country:***

***Product Name:***

***Sku:***
Store Keeping Unit (SKU) is a unique number assigned to each product.This helps in sorting customers based on the unique id number.
Example:
The SKU id for 16GB pen drive is 006. Use this condition to find out all the customers who have purchased 16GB pendrive.
The difference between product name and Sku id is that sometimes you know only the product name and not the id number. You can use product name condition in that case.

By default, there are three segments created when a user registers with campaign rabbit. Cool right !

Primarily, conditions work based on two type of operations.

***Match All:***
The segment displays the list of customers only when all the given conditions are met.
Works like and operation.
Example:
The order status is set to complete and the country is given as USA. When match all is given, list of customers whose country is USA with the order status as completed will be displayed.

***Match Any:***
The display result is list of customers if any one of the given condition is satisfied.
Works like or operation.
Example:
The last ordered is lesser than 10 days and the price is greater than $1000. When Match any is given, it lists both, the price greater than $1000 and the last ordered is less than 10 days.

Segments are an optional setup
This might have been a little bit monotonous but trust me, this article will be of great use when you wish to work independently.
