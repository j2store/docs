# Limitations of the booking product type

The following are the known limitations of the booking product:

- Though the booking product allows the store owners to set up fixed or pre-defined bookable time slots in terms of hours and minutes, the product doesn't support the store owners to allow users to choose the start and end hour(or minutes). That is customer-defined blocks of hours and customer-defined block of minutes are not supported.

- Though you could set up person type based booking products, it is not possible to maintain or manage inventory based on the number of persons chosen by the user on the storefront.

**Instance**

For example: Person types allowed are as follows:
 1) Adult
 2) Children

 When a user books a particular time slot for 2 adults and 2 children, then this would not affect the Max bookings allowed per block.
