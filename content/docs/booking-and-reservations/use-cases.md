In this guide we are going to get to know few scenarios where the booking extension could be used: 

* Book a conference hall
* Book a service
* Book for a boat ride
* Book a hall

**Scenario:**
1. Renting the hall on a daily basis.
2. Setting the capacity of the hall to 50 persons.
3. Booking slots will be available only on week days and not on weekends.

**Creating a product**
1. Go to Article manager and create a new article.
2. Move to J2Store cart tab and choose YES to treat as a product.
3. Choose product type as Booking and save.

**General tab**
After creating the product, navigate to general tab.

**Booking duration**
In our sample scenario, we are renting the hall on a daily basis. So Set the Booking duration to Fixed blocks of 1 day(s).

**Pricing tab**
Set the pricing and navigate to the next tab.

**Persons tab**
Our instance says that we are going to restrict the capacity only to 50 Persons. So following are the criteria to be set:

Min persons = 1
Max persons = 50

**Availability tab**
The hall would be rented on a daily basis. The parameters should be set as follows:

Max bookings per block = 1
Minimum block bookable= 1 day(s) into the future
Maximum block bookable= 30 day(s) into the future

To restrict the availability of the hall only to week days and block the availability on weekends:

Range type = Range of days
Range = Saturday to Sunday
Bookable = No

Here are the screenshots that demonstrate the workflow of the above conditions:
