Developing extensions for J2Store is fairly a simple process. The guide will help you understand the plugin/app structure used by J2Store

J2Store primarily has four extension types:

1. Payment plugins
2. Shipping plugins
3. Reporting plugins
4. Apps
5. Promotion / discount plugins

NOTE: This is a work in progress. Feel free to contribute.
