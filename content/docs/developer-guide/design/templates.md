**Choose Layout to display  products**

J2Store uses the default Joomla articles as products. So an article can be a product. That means you can use the Category blog, Single article layout for showcasing products.

We also provide an awesome Product List Layout with a lots of controls. And it supports the sub-template concept like the K2. You can create any number of sub-templates and each can have a unique style.

For example, the store front has two categories: Fruits, Vegetables.You can create a sub-template for fruits and set its own styles.You can create another sub-template for Vegetables and it can have its own styles.The possibilities are limitless.

By default, j2store comes with two sub-templates

1. Default - This is based on the Bootstrap 2.x
2. Bootstrap 3 - As the name says, this supports the Bootstrap 3 markup.

So you can build you sub-template by copying one of these.
